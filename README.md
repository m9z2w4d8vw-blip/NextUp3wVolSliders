NextUp 3 is a modern revival of the classic
[NextUp](https://github.com/Nosskirneh/NextUp) tweak (iOS 11 – 13). It adds
an **Up Next row** to the system now-playing UI showing the next track with its
artwork, so you always know what's coming and can act on it before it plays.

## Features

- **Works everywhere** — Lock Screen, Control Center, and the Dynamic
  Island expanded player (iOS 16+).
- **Skip ahead** — remove the upcoming track from the queue with one tap, or tap
  its artwork to play it right now.
- **Bring back the previous track** — re-queue what just played as the next track.
- **Volume slider on the Lock Screen** *(opt-in, iOS 16/17)* — Apple lays its own
  volume row out in Control Center but only shows it on the Lock Screen while the
  session is on AirPlay. Switch this on and it appears for local playback too.
- **Swipe gestures** — swipe the row for an interactive carousel: ← skips the
  next track, → puts the track you just heard back into the queue as up next,
  with neighbour artwork sliding in as you drag.
- **Native look on every version** — the row adopts each iOS version's
  now-playing style (padding, corner radii, and button feedback are matched to
  Apple's own player), so it feels built-in everywhere.
- **Per-app and per-surface toggles** — a Settings pane lets you enable/disable
  each app and each surface (Lock Screen / Control Center / Dynamic Island);
  changes apply instantly, no respring. The pane lists only what your device
  has: apps that are actually installed, and the Dynamic Island row only where
  there is an island (including one enabled by a tweak such as VisibleIsland).
- **Accessible & localized** — VoiceOver, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast and
  Dynamic Type support; 27 languages.

## Install

- **[Havoc](https://havoc.app/package/nextup3)** (recommended) — search for
  *NextUp 3* in your package manager.
- Or grab the `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/Yves000/NextUp3/releases)
  and install it with Sileo / Filza / `dpkg -i`.

Dependencies (installed automatically): `libSandy`, `PreferenceLoader`, and
ElleKit or Substrate. The package restarts the media apps by itself; just
respring when your package manager asks. Uninstalling cleans up everything the
tweak wrote (settings and play history).

## Known issues

- The Lock Screen volume slider is **not yet verified on-device**, and it is off by
  default for that reason. See "Lock-screen volume row" below for what to expect and
  what to send back if it doesn't show up.
- Apple Podcasts is not yet verified on iOS 26 (every other app and surface is).
- Spotify and YouTube Music integrations are built against specific app versions
  (see table above); an app update can silently break them until the tweak is
  updated.

# For developers

NextUp 3 is a Theos tweak. One dylib is injected into six processes and behaves
differently per process:

- **Providers** (one per media app, inside `com.apple.Music`,
  `com.apple.podcasts`, `com.google.ios.youtubemusic`, `com.spotify.client`):
  read that app's live queue, serve the current "next up" (title / artist /
  artwork) over IPC, and perform skip / play-now / previous using the app's own
  in-process queue API.
- **Display side** (`com.apple.MediaRemoteUI` and `com.apple.springboard`):
  hooks the now-playing player per surface and iOS version, draws the row
  (`NUNextUpRowView`), and talks to whichever provider owns the current
  now-playing session (`NUNextUpManager`).

**IPC:** app sandboxes can't register bootstrap services, so each provider runs a
[LightMessaging](https://github.com/rpetrich/LightMessaging) (mach) server under
a [libSandy](https://github.com/opa334/libSandy) profile that grants the
mach-register/lookup extensions (`layout/Library/libSandy/com.yves.nextup3.plist`).
Darwin notifications signal "queue changed" (provider → display) and
skip / previous / jump (display → provider). Payload-free, sandbox-crossing,
instant.

## Repo structure

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `hooks/*.x` | Logos hooks, split per process / surface / iOS version — each with its own `%ctor` gate. `NUHooksLockScreen{14,15,18}.x`, `NUHooksControlCenter{Legacy,18,26}.x`, `NUHooksDynamicIsland{16,17}.x`, `NUHooksNowPlaying.x` (shared player plumbing), `NUHooksSpringBoard.x` (swipe-vs-system-gesture arbitration), `NUHooksTCC.x` (iOS ≤ 16 usage-description shim), plus one `NUHooks<App>Provider.x` per app |
| `NU<App>Provider.{h,m}` | The four providers (`Music`, `Podcast`, `YouTubeMusic`, `Spotify`), all on `NUProviderBase` |
| `NUNextUpManager.{h,m}` | Display side: source tracking, per-source LightMessaging client, snapshot state |
| `NUNextUpRowView.{h,m}` | The row UI: artwork, labels, skip button, swipe carousel |
| `NUHooksShared.{h,m}` | Cross-hook helpers (process gates, view lookup, CC row layout) |
| `NUShared.h` | IPC service names, Darwin notification names, `NUApplySandbox()` |
| `NUPrefs.{h,m}` | Prefs: live state on a notify-state token, CFPreferences as persisted fallback |
| `NUVolumeControls.{h,m}` | Lock-screen volume row: runtime discovery of MediaRemoteUI's volume-availability gates, `NUVolumeStripView` (our own slider, AVSystemController-backed), and the DEBUG probe |
| `NUPrivate.h` | Private-API interface declarations (class-dump + Frida-verified) |
| `NULocalization.h` / `NULogFile.m` | String lookup; DEBUG-only file log sink |
| `prefs/` | PreferenceLoader settings pane + 27 localizations |
| `layout/` | libSandy sandbox profile |
| `vendor/` | Vendored LightMessaging / libSandy headers (see `vendor/README.md`) |

## Build & deploy

Requires [Theos](https://theos.dev) (roothide fork for the roothide variant)
and Xcode. The tweak builds against whatever recent iOS SDK your Xcode ships;
no patched SDK is needed because every private interface is declared in the
source itself (`NUPrivate.h` and the provider files). Only the Settings pane
needs one SDK from [theos/sdks](https://github.com/theos/sdks) in
`$THEOS/sdks` (any iOS 1x version works), since Xcode SDKs ship no linker stub
for the private Preferences framework. Set `NUPREFS_PRIVATE_SDK=` to pick a
specific one.

```sh
make package FINALPACKAGE=1              # roothide (default)
make package ROOTLESS=1 FINALPACKAGE=1   # rootless (palera1n / Dopamine)
make package ROOTFUL=1 FINALPACKAGE=1    # rootful — the iOS 14.2 build
make package DEBUG=1                     # dev build with NULog logging

# install the .deb from packages/ — its postinst restarts the media apps and
# MediaRemoteUI. SpringBoard hosts hooks too, so finish with a respring:
killall SpringBoard
```

## Lock-screen volume row

`MRUNowPlayingView` has a `volumeControlsView` and lays it out in Control Center on
every version we support. On the lock screen it only appears while MediaRemote thinks
the session's volume is controllable — i.e. on AirPlay — so local playback gets no
slider. Two ways back in, and `NUVolumeControls.m` implements both because which one
works is an on-device question:

- **Native** (default): the availability gate isn't the same selector on every build,
  so `NUVolumeForceNativeGates()` *discovers* it — it walks the classes in
  MediaRemoteUI's image, finds every zero-argument `BOOL` getter whose selector
  mentions volume, classifies it (`…Available` / `…SupportsVolume…` / `shouldShow…`
  → force YES; `…Hidden` / `…Disabled` → force NO; anything that reads like live
  interaction state — `isDragging`, `isTracking`, `…Muted` — is left alone) and
  swizzles it through `imp_implementationWithBlock`. Each replacement re-reads the
  preference, so the Settings switch applies live and a disabled tweak calls through
  to `%orig`. Apple then builds, wires and measures its own row, which means the
  platter grows through Apple's own `-sizeThatFits:` and the existing height plumbing
  carries it across the process boundary for free.
- **Custom** (`Use NextUp's Own Slider`, or automatic after the native row stays
  unlaid-out for three layout passes): `NUVolumeStripView` — speaker glyph, slider,
  speaker glyph, styled off the same adaptive foreground as the Up Next row — drawn
  into a strip reserved exactly the way the row is (`NUVolumeGrowthForView` →
  `NUFitGrowthForView` → the `-bounds` clamp), directly above the row so the order
  reads like Apple's player. System volume goes through `AVSystemController`
  (`getVolume:forCategory:` / `setVolumeTo:forCategory:`, category `Audio`), and the
  strip subscribes to `AVSystemController_SystemVolumeDidChangeNotification` so it
  follows the hardware buttons. A throwaway `MPVolumeView` sits offscreen inside the
  strip purely to suppress SpringBoard's volume HUD.

Scope is **the lock screen on iOS 16 and 17** — the versions whose lock-screen player
is the `MRUNowPlayingView` that Control Center shares. iOS 14/15 host it in-process
behind `CSMediaControlsViewController` (different height levers, see
`NUHooksLockScreen14/15`) and iOS 18 replaced it with `MRULockscreenView`, so the
Settings rows hide themselves there rather than offering a dead toggle. Control Center
and the Dynamic Island already have Apple's slider and are untouched.

If the row doesn't turn up, build with `make package DEBUG=1` and unlock with music
playing: `NUVolumeProbeOnce` dumps every volume-shaped selector MediaRemoteUI declares,
its return encoding, its live answer on the player, and how the classifier scored it —
which is enough to name the real gate instead of guessing at it.

## Adding support for another app

The design is table-driven, so a new source stays localized:

1. **`NUShared.h`** — add `kNUServiceName<X>` (+ `kNUSkipNotification<X>` /
   `kNUPrevNotification<X>` as needed), following the
   `com.yves.nextup3.<kind>.<source>` naming convention.
2. **`NUNextUpManager.m`** — add a `NUSource<X>` enum case and a case in each
   per-source table function: `NUSourceForBundleID`, `NUConnectionForSource`
   (+ a `gConn<X>`), `NUAppPrefKeyForSource`, `NUSkipNotificationForSource`,
   `NUPrevNotificationForSource`. The callers need no edits.
3. **`NUPrefs.h` + `NUPrefs.m`** — add `kNUStateApp<X>` (next free bit), its
   `NUStateBitForKey` case, and its `NUPrefsPublishState()` line. *Easy to miss
   and a silent failure*: without these the Settings switch looks right but
   never takes effect live.
4. **`prefs/Resources/Root.plist`** — one `PSSwitchCell` in the "Apps" group
   (`key` = the same `enabled<X>` string from `NUAppPrefKeyForSource`).
5. **Provider** — new `NU<X>Provider.{h,m}` on `NUProviderBase` plus
   `hooks/NUHooks<X>Provider.x` (its `%ctor` calls `NUApplySandbox()` before
   gating on `NUIs<X>()`), and add `NUIs<X>()` to `NUHooksShared.h`.
   **Don't forget the `NUIsDisplaySide()` exclusion**, or every display hook
   initializes inside the new app too.
6. **Plumbing** — `NextUp3.plist` (bundle id), `Makefile` (source files +
   `INSTALL_TARGET_PROCESSES`, which takes *executable* names, not bundle ids),
   the libSandy profile (register/lookup extensions for the new service name and
   the app's signing identifier in `AllowedProcesses`), and `control`'s
   description.
